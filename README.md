# Graphics-2D-Project---Atmospheric-Layer-Structure

Atmospheric Layer Structure is a 2D graphics project idea that shows the atmospheric layers surrounding the world. The activity and characteristics of each real life vehicle or element in a particular layer is shown through animation. According to the atmospheric layers around the world, the five layers are shown with different colors to show the difference. Then the different attributes of each layer is shown with air vehicle or cloud or satellite etc.
This project tries to be a helping tool for young learners to help them learn about the Atmospheric Layers through interactive session since they can interact with the program with mouse and keyboard and see the transitions. The characteristics of each layer is described in different windows with brief description. Special effects about different and significant events like Ultraviolet Ray or Thunder Effect are also shown.
